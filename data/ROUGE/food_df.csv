It has a light omega-3 fishy oil after taste. Just when I have a thought of going to supermarket getting some ribs to do slow BBQ, I just tried four spoons of hempseed and my craving for soft tender ribs disappear in my head. So I guess it has all the needed stuff you can get from tasty meat with less required cooking time. So Nutiva hempseed is pretty fresh based on the taste and texture of the seeds. My bag was packaged 45 days ago. I separate 1/4 lbs into a smaller ziplock bag leaving in the fridge and the rest went to a bigger ziplock in the freezer.",Food
1179,"I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive about trying these because of a couple of the reviews here. One person even said they were disgusting and she had to throw them away.But I was pleasantly surprised to find that IMO these are excellent, and very easy to use. Just drain and rinse, make any Asian noodle dish from Vietnamese soup to Japanese stir fry, and they are wonderful!Once when I was lazy and didn't feel like going to a lot of effort, I just pan-roasted them, sprinkled on some grinder garlic pepper seasoning, and they were good even like that.There are a lot of recipes I found online that I would like to try. The possibilities are endless.I think I could eat these every day. And I just might.",Food
1506,"I was disappointed in the size of the fig bars. I received some as a gift in the past, and they were three times the size of these bars. The ones I received here, look like they are bite size, fun size, or children's size. I think I was misled by the image shown of this product. I think it would have helped to show a horizontal picture of the bar. Also, maybe put in the description that these are ""fun size"" fig bars so people know they are not the normal size they should be.On a good note, these bars are very tasty. I will just have to make sure I order the correct size next time.",Food
957,"When I first found this mustard at a local grocery store, I was blown away...but then it disappeared from every store that I have been to since, so my only option is online.  Since first trying Plochman's Kosciusko Beer Mustard, (and then agonizing over the loss of it), I tried every Spicy Brown mustard I could find...but no others measured up.  Finally, I found it online, and the celebration lasted for days!This mustard is certainly not the spiciest, but I do believe it is the most flavorful.  It just seems to go with everything I try it on - it makes any sandwich 100% better, plain cold cuts are made magnificent, pretzels reach perfection, and it is not unusual at all for me to sneak downstairs late at night to have a spoonful of this wonderful stuff.  It provides the perfect companion to the cheapest hotdogs, but also to the best gourmet bratwursts.  Bland burgers need just a dab of this mustard to become superb; I have yet to find any kind of meat, sandwich, or snack that is not made better by this mustard!I think this mustard should be registered with the FDA as a drug because it is super-addictive.  Try it, and see if you can put it down.  Be warned...one jar will not be enough.",Food
3893,"I am a little ticked at an email from Amazon stating that this is not available so they were canceling my order, followed by constantly keeping these bags of Skittles in my recommended items.  I bought some to send to my nieces and nephews, had joked with my brother and sister about how they were going to deal with so much candy.  I'll bring presents next time to make up for the failure of this to appear. I'll remain a huge purchaser from Amazon in the tens of thousands per year between me and my wife, but things like this are annoying enough for me to waste my time writing this post. . .",Food
3854,"After my first few gulps I thought it tasted decent.  However, after half a can it started to take on a strange and somewhat unpleasant taste.  I still couldn't tell you what the flavor was.  Some sort of ""fruit punch"".  It does do what it says it is supposed to do which is give you an energy pick up.  I have tried a bunch of different energy drinks from various companies and they are all pretty similar.  Lots of caffeine, Vit B, guarana, and similar ingredients.  There effectiveness depends on individuals' resistance to these stimulants.  I drink several cups of coffee and/or energy drinks a day so the effects are there but minimal compared to my wife who is smaller and will only have an occasional cup of tea or coffee.  She drinks one of these and is bouncing off the walls.  For me it comes down to taste and I am not a fan of this flavor.  I would also choose a no- or low-calories version.",Food
503,"I got a free sample of this product (ground coffee beans) from the Starbucks company today (December 29, 2010).  The artificial vanilla flavor was NOT impressive.  It simply does not taste much like vanilla.  The added ""vanilla"" just provides some off-beat chemical flavor.  Even worse, is that this chemical flavor lingers on the metal coffee filter, and contaminates the flavor of any coffee that is subsequently brewed.Another overall problem with Starbucks coffee is that, in an attempt to imitate Peet's coffee, the Starbucks company provides a generous roasting of their coffee, but they over-roast their coffee to the point that the overwhelming flavor is one of charred or burned wood.Thus, for my 5-cup a day habit, I stick to Folger's, and when I want to treat myself, I buy Peets.  I am not sure why the Starbucks company is so successful, but I am sure it has MORE TO DO with their nice furniture, the creative nomenclature of their coffees, various other marketing gimmicks, and the endless selection of sugared, candied, confectioned, and embellished coffees, and LESS TO DO with the quality of the coffee itself.As a graduate student at U.C. Berkeley, I lived directly across the street from the first Peet's coffee shop, located at Walnut Square in Berkeley, California.  I first went to Peet's in the year 1973.",Food
3600,"I make almost all of my baby's food, but we buy some for on-the-go and unexpected outings.  The bar is set very high on taste and quality, as my 9 month old has refused to eat some brands we have tried to feed him.  I also always taste anything I feed to my son, so again, I have high expectations.  This food was a great deal, and we like the Earth's Best brand, so I bought some.  My son loves it, and I think it tastes great.  An easy way for breakfast on-the-go, instead of having to deal with mixing rice or oatmeal cereal and his fruit.  The only warning I have is that I thought I would be getting a banana/grain & apricot/grain variety pack, but it is banana/apricot/grain all in one jar.  The wording was a little confusing & the flavor on the jar pictured was really small.  But it turned out to be a hit!",Food
2841,"Quaker Oatmeal Squares have a bland taste.  A hint of brown sugar coats each square, and it is exactly that - just a hint.  According to the label, this cereal has 210 calories per 1 cup serving without milk and 250 with skim milk. It boasts 5g dietary fiber and 2g soluble fiber.  For 210 or 250 calories, I think it should have more flavor, but for those who don't like any sugar in cereal, this works out well, especially if they prefer a high-fiber one.  Personally, I wouldn't purchase these oatmeal squares and would opt for a nutritious cereal with more taste.",Food
2454,"I've tried Wilton's fondant before, which tasted horrible and wasn't that easy to work with. Fondarific fondant is amazing! It takes color very nicely, I use Wilton's gel colors, and is very easy to work with. It's a little hard when you take it out of the container, but I just pop it in the microwave for 10seconds and it becomes soft enough for me to work with.This fondant tastes soooo good! Like cotton candy. Delicious!!I made a 3 tier birthday cake using this stuff and I still have some fondant left over.My tiers were 10"", 8"" and 6"". The first two tiers were 4"" tall and the 6"" tier was 8"" tall. I also used this for decorations.Everyone at the party loved it!",Food
2890,"I must admit when I first ordered this bread for my new Panasonic bread maker, I was not expecting anything other than potato bread such as I buy at a nearby store. However, was I ever surprised! It was absolutely the best stuff and with some organic butter piled high and properly melted it was on a par with ambrosia. I just could not believe how good it was and is. Since the first loaf, I have made other breads which have been generally excellent but none are quite at the level of this potato bread. It is REALLY good! Perhaps the credit goes to my new bread machine! Highly recommended!!!  GENERAL INFO: The package makes a 1.5 pound loaf. On my machine the recommended setting is BASIC and the loaf bakes in 4 hours. Also, the flour is NON GMO Verified as labelled.",Food
3868,"Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China.Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner.  Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat.  I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food.When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own.  My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety.  In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too.  While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell ""dog food"".  When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat.  It actually smells good.  Imagine that.",Food
3901,"When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert ""3-4 mm"" to inches and consequently discovered the ""Coarse Grinder Salt"" was almost 1/4"" (1/6"" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!",Food
2812,"We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.",Food
1793,"No, its not going to compare to your local Indian restaurant's tikka masala. But, it is fast and delicous. Unlike some other bottled sauces Ive tried, this one does not have an overwhelming clove taste.  The seasonings were quite balanced.I marinated chicken thighs (cheaper and more flavor), with greek yogurt and a couple tablespoons of this sauce overnight.  I baked the thighs for about 20mins on a cookiesheet, cut the chicken up roughly and put it into simmering sauce for another 10mins with some colliflower.  I enjoyed it. I only wish I had some Naan and Bastima rice which I couldnt find at my local grocery store.",Food
3951,"They taste really good. Problem is. I have been told by many many people dried fruit is one of the best snacks ever because its good and healthy. Turns out this treat is not so healthy as implied. Im not sure if its maybe dried fruit just has alot of carbs, or the company on purposely fattened it up. But if you just look on the nutritional label you'll see. Its not as bad as a candy bar, or chips. But its not ""healthy"" either. Great product none the less. I think if I dont over indulge on these and drink mostly water, it will be better for me :)",Food
3906,"These taste great.  More of a restaurant style chip taste as opposed to a Frito-Lay for the masses taste.Salty enough too, unlike say Tostitos which have reduced the salt far too low.  But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today.",Food
495,"I love flavored tea (my favorite is the Chili's strawberry flavor, just to give you an idea of the flavor I like), so I thought I'd give this a try.  It's a really neat idea and the bottle is small enough to fit in your pocket, a small purse, or your car console.  It has zero calories, sugar, etc., so it is a diet drink and tastes like it no matter how much or little you use.  The one thing I really don't like about it is that it does not drip out in small drops, you squeeze it and the least that you can squeeze out is about a full tablespoon, which means your water really can't ever taste like water with a touch of flavored tea, it tastes like watered down flavored tea.  I was hoping you could do smaller drops to get more of a light flavored water taste, but it doesn't work that way.",Food
3975,"The description for this product makes some rather bold claims such as normalizing your blood pressure, proving a better night's sleep, boosting heart health, and muscle strength.  When I see these sorts of claims, I get very suspicious.  I'm not a scientist, but these sorts of claims bother me when no studies are cited.From what I can tell, the 9.5 pH level is achieved by the addition of sodium bicarbonate, the same ingredient in many antacids.  If you really hate the taste of antacids, trying this water to get relief might be worth it.I have to admit that this water really does taste great.  It's difficult to describe the taste exactly, but it tastes much better than most bottled waters.For some odd reason, this water gave me a stomach ache, so despite the taste, I won't give it another try.I marginally recommend this item if you want to give it a try for relieving indigestion.",Food
2501,"I prepare this on a regular basis (along with Fantastic World Foods Falafel mix) for several reasons.  It's one of my family's favorites.  Allow me to enumerate the reasons why:1) It's easy.  Add the package to boiling water and olive oil.  Allow the tabouli mix to soak up the liquid.  Once soaked, mix with a diced cucumber and a chopped tomato.  Refrigerate in a resealable container.  Even a non-cook can master this!2) It makes A TON of food.  I don't consume more than 1/2 cup at a time, and the other two members of my family do the same.  We're able to eat on this three times before it's gone.  That's usually two dinners and a lunch.3) It's easy to make a meal with this.  Buy hummus (or get the fabulous mix from Fantastic Foods!), the aforementioned Fantastic Foods Falafel mix, pita bread, and olives, and prepare to please a crowd.4) It's TASTY.  I avoid wasting money on eating out by buying Fantastic Foods products because they taste much the same as the fare offered at my local Greek restaurant.  I think this tabouli tastes better than the one at my local Greek place.5) Again, it's cheap.  I can make three meals for my family for less than $12 total using the Fantastic Foods hummus, falafel, and tabouli.  That price includes pita bread, olives, and vegetables.  That's a pretty good deal, if you ask me!If you like Greek/Middle Eastern food, pick this up.  Your tastebuds and your wallet will thank you.",Food
1336,"We got these as a x-mas gift and this is the BEST treat! I am very careful about what I give my Shih Tzu who is a puppymill rescue and has health issues. This treat is a 100% natural made with 100% chicken and also VERY IMPORTANT is that it is NOT MADE IN CHINA. I never give my dog anything that is made in China (I have relatives in China and trust me you do not want to feed your dog anything that is made there) so there have been very few options out there for my dog. The added plus is that both my dog and cat LOVE these treats. My dog is more finicky than my cat and they both go crazy over these and b/c I know they are 100% natural chicken I feel confident giving them the treats. There are, however, two drawbacks and that is why I can't give it 5 stars. 1) A lot of the treats are wasted b/c they crumble and at least 1/4 of the bag looks like it is filled with sawdust (crumbs from the broken treats). Many of the pieces also crumble into pea-size pieces which are too small for a dog. Fortunately my cat does not mind the tiny pieces so I give these to him. These treats are also very expensive which I don't mind b/c the quality is so good but for this price, I wish so much would not go to waste. 2) Like another reviewer said, you do need to be careful b/c I have found a bone in them as well. I found a bone about an inch long embedded in one of the treats so now I am careful to inspect the treat before giving it to my dog. Even with these drawbacks, I still feel these are the best treats out there if you are looking for 1) healthy, 2)natural, 3) tasty treats that are 4) MADE IN USA. In my experience, it is nearly impossible to meet all 4 criteria. This is the only treat that does (at least for my pets where taste is concerned. My pets refuse to eat Newman's treats even though they are healthy).",Food
1774,"OK, let's admit it.  Baked tortilla chips as a rule aren't that great, so this review reflects both my feelings about the basic concept of this snack as well as the specifics for this particular one.Like most baked tortilla chips, these are kind of large, hard, and thick.  The seasoning is very subtle, so if you like baked tortilla chips in general, don't shy away from these because you're concerned they'll be too spinach-y, too salty or too artichoke-y because they're not.  But also don't expect them to taste like that yummy appetizer dip you can order in most restaurants.  They don't....this is very subtle seasoning.This brand of baked tortilla chips is a bit different from some others I've tasted because they are harder and thicker than some others.  However, in terms of nutrition alone, they are probably better for us than most of the other options. In fact, I gave this product an extra star because I feel that this company does have a genuine commitment to making snacks as healthy as possible, so I trust that these are as good for you as tortilla chips can be.Personally I'd rather save my  tortilla chip experience for those rare occasions when I go out to a Mexican restaurant and enjoy those thin, home-made, yummy tortilla chips.  But that's just me.  If your family loves tortilla chips and wants to eat them weekly at home while watching TV, these aren't a bad choice at all.",Food
1545,"As a preface, my cat is almost 12 years old. He was diagnosed with diabetes 2 years ago but after one year I changed his diet from both wet and hard food to just wet food, he lost a couple lbs(from 17 to 15) and subsequently went into remission. At the time I had put him on Wellness cat food. He had no problems giving up the dry food and was never really picky about the wet food I gave him.Starting several months ago my cat started throwing up a lot more often, sometimes twice a day. I thought it was new plants that I had gotten in the house as he loved chewing on them. I home glucose test him and his numbers were just a bit higher at the time so I brought him in to the vet to check on him. They did a blood sample and checked his organs. The vet said his organs were fine and his stomach wasn't blocked and that his numbers weren't significantly high enough to put him back on insulin. They did suggest I change the food of his diet though as he might have become allergic or ""sensitive"" to the wet food I was giving him. They suggested a higher protein diet of venison or rabbit. Of course, they offered their ""Vet Only"" brands for an absurd amount of money. Then I went on Amazon and did a search for these type of foods and came across this brand.I ordered up a case to try seeing as this cost pretty much exactly the same as I have been paying for the Wellness brand at the local store. Upon opening the first can I inspected the consistency and smell of this new food. First thing I liked was how loose the food was. I normally have to chop up my cats food because he is more of a licker than a biter when eating. This seemed like it would be easier for him to get down. When it came to the smell, I thought it actually smelled good. I read a lot of reviews where people said it smelled terrible or offensive. I have a very sensitive nose and can get turned off by smelly things very quickly. This wasnt bad at all and if anything, smelled better than the Wellness formula I had been feeding him.My cat inspected the first plate of food but then dove right in. My cat is a grazer so I normally leave a can out for him and he would finish it over the course of about 24 hours. The first can was gone in 6 hours. I put out another can and that can was gone in 10 hours. I now have him(or he has me) on a schedule of a fresh can every 12 hours. So yes, he goes through the food a lot faster than his old food and this is costing me now twice of what it was before but Im glad he is eating as much as he is. The unfortunately part now is that he will wake me up at any point during the night to tell me he is out of food. Since starting him on this new diet I have not had one full nights sleep. I suppose thats a different dilemma however.My cat is now throwing up a lot less but does still throw up. I am seeing more hairballs though as the reason for throwing up. I do brush him down as much as I can but he seems to throw up soon after the brushing as he tends to groom himself a lot more now as well. He seems a lot happier with this food and processes it a lot quicker too. In the morning when I clean out the litter box every day it seems like I have two cats in the house, there is that much more pee and poo.Either way, I definitely recommend this food to anyone with a cat who has been throwing up or is sensitive to other foods.",Food
2758,"Our dogs (30lb and 40lb Corgi/border collie mixes) love it, it's about the right level of difficulty.It was evident pretty quickly, though, that as soon as our bigger dog figured out how to sink his teeth into the plastic enough to pick it up from the bottom and bash it against things to shake the contents out that it was going to have a rough life, and so it's proven.After a couple months of fairly regular use, the body of the jug has split all the way down from the mouth to the bottom cap on two sides.

1190,"I use these frequently.  Calorie and carbohydrate free, but just as filling as spaghetti.  Although they don't taste like standard pasta, they're a wonderful substitute for when you have carb cravings.  The fishy smell rinses right away and they absorb the flavor of the sauce.  A little on the strange side with texture - 'rubbery' sounds worse than it is, but I can't figure out another description.  Still really enjoy them.  I use udon seasoning packets or boullion usually, but pasta sauce works well. I find that if you rinse and prepare them, then allow to sit an hour or so to absorb the flavor, it works really well.  Toss them in the microwave and voila!  Great product.",Food
