"Original Review: This cable does the job but beware if you are looking for anything longer than the ASUS brand cable that came with the Nexus 7 It's the same length. But the price is right and the cable seems sturdy enough.

Update: We recently made a trip and I took this cable along, along with the original ASUS charger. Big mistake! As noted in other reviews the cable was incredibly slow in charging my Nexus 7. I left it plugged in overnight and it was only at 22% the next morning. When I returned home I tried the charger with this cable and found that after 10 minutes the batter charge increased from 85% to 86%. Using the same charger and the original ASUS cable for the same 10 minutes, the battery had increases from 86% to 89%. I left the Nexus 7 connected to the charger with the ASUS cable and it reached 100% charge after about an hour.

The cable works fine for copying music and image files back and forth from my PC but it is sorely deficient as a charger cable. Ergo the downgrade in my rating from 4 to 2 stars.","This cable does the job and is sturdy but is the same length as the ASUS cable that came with the Nexus 7.

"At the time of writing this review (9-9-2014) I have been using this KVM daily for the past 3 years with no problems whatsoever. I did not purchase from Amazon, I bought it online from Wal-Mart, which had a better price at the time.

I use this switch on a Windows 98 computer, and a Windows Vista computer. The only complaint that I have about this switch is the cables. If I remember correctly, they are only 4 feet long. I had to rearrange how I run the wires from each computer, but it isn't that big of a deal. I am docking 1 star because of this. I think that the cables should be at least six feet long. However, over the past few years, I have really liked how this KVM made me move the computers - they are both right next to each other, rather than one being farther away.

If you are looking for a quality, budget minded KVM that supports audio switching between the two computers, I highly recommend this unit!","I have been using this KVM that I purchased online from Wal-Mart for the past 3 years no problem.

"I never thought to check what keys are and are not on a keyboard before purchasing this item.  It has a smaller size than the Kensington keyboard case I usually use (just a little smaller) but that reduced size means that some keys are changed/removed.  If you are used to touch typing and hitting the ""shift"" key with your right pinky, you are in for an unpleasant surprise.  There is no shift key on the right side of this keyboard.  I find myself constantly hitting where that shift should be when typing and on this keyboard and it is the ""enter"" key.  Have to stop and backspace back up....... aggravating.  The solid surface keyboard sounds like a good idea as well, but like many reviewers I find that it takes extra pressure and you are never sure that just because you pushed a key the letter will appear.  I find it slow to use because I have to constantly read what I am typing and backspace to put in letters where it skipped because I didn't hit the key hard enough.  Cute color.  Like the size.  Have no complaints on sturdiness, just don't like the keyboard itself.  I use my Kensington most of the time because I can type rapidly on it while I can't on this keyboard.

Update - after using this case for a month, I noticed what another reader had commented on.  The case does indeed begin to stretch just enough that the home button and camera are not lined up with the notches and holes in the case.  The flap that holds the iPad in has also stretched/given out to the point that the iPad constantly slides out of that side a little. It's become aggravating enough that I'm going back to my old keyboard case.","I never had to check the keys on the keyboard until I bought this smaller keyboard. The reduced size means that keys are changed/removed. I find myself having to adjust for typing mistakes. The keyboard sounds good, but it takes extra pressure to use.

"Several things I like about this helmet.  1. Color looks very nice 2. the ratchet type chin strap can be done with gloves on after a bit of getting used to it.  3. drop down sun shield that is inside the full clear face shield (I have another helmet where the sun shield flips up on the outside allowing the wind to catch it) BUT the padding on this size small is super thick.  It seems like they take a one size fits all approach. I bought a size SMALL but this helmet looks like an XL sized shell with THICK padding to fill the space to make it fit a small head. Some brands have several sizes of shells like a xsamll/small, Med/Large and XL/XXL.  I was hoping this would compare to my Nolan open face at a much lower price...I have an older Nolan that does not have the sun shield. I know helmets can make us look a bit like Marvin Martian but this is just soooo big looking!  I will keep it and give it a chance but will save my pennies for the Newer version of Nolan's open face with the sunshield.","I like the color of this helmet, the easy ratchet type chin strap , and the drop down sunshield.

"I was not very impressed with these books, though I have enjoyed previous Heidi Betts novels. It's possible I just don't like a novella length romance - I do not read them often. Also, these three books (especially the first two) were more erotica than romance, which I was not expecting.

I feel like the focus was too much on sex and not enough on the characters and forging a romance. The sex scenes were very long and drawn out, and the characters spent very little time interacting with each other outside of the sex. I am not prudish - I like my romance novels to have sexy time in them - but this just felt like those porno movies that try to have a plot but really shouldn't bother because people only watch them for the sex. There wasn't a lot of plot or character depth here.

Also, I found Betts' vampires to be extremely boring. It's like True Blood vampires Disneyfied. Her vampires are out in the open publicly and drink synthetic blood called ""NuBlood"" (hmmmmm). Other than that, they don't act like vampires at all. I like my vampires to have a little bit of bloodlust, a little edge... Eric Northman is sexy, these vampires were just BLAH. I would have preferred them to not even BE vampires and the stories would probably have been much better.

I wouldn't really recommend this book - her knitting romance trilogy was much better. This just fell flat for me.","I was not impressed with these books although I liked Heidi Bett’s previous novels. They were more erotica than novel, with not a lot of plot or character depth here. I found the vampires ot be extremely boring characters. Outside drinking blood they don’t act liek vampires at all.

"Horrible tech support. I have had this thing for over 30 days and it still can't connect to the internet. Agreed, it may be something that Im not doing correctly, but tech support should have been able to assist. All I got was attitude from the tech person. Very disappointed with this device so far. I suspect once i am able to finally get this NAS configured correctly, it will work. IF anyone out there want to make $50 by walking me through how to configure this, I will pay you.

"Their Harmony One was probably the best remote ever done. On here there are no number buttons, and the touch screen is 'touchy'. On all other remotes at the bottom are number buttons, where your hand would naturally be, this makes changing channels awkward. Skip/Fast forward are now the same button, unlike before and it is very hard to skip 30 seconds and get it to stop where you want. And you must create an account, log in using their own software, and connect to the internet for setup and to make any changes.
If you drop it they will break.
Mine is without the hub, and I got so fed up, I found a refurbished Harmony One on a 'bay' site, and never looked back.",Harmony One is the best remote ever done with a touchy touch screen and no number buttons. Other remotes have awkward layouts and require accounts and internet connection to set up an user. They are also fragile. My remote was without a hub so I replaced it with a refurbished Harmony One.
"UPDATE:  dropping to two stars. due to wireless function loss.

January 26 2014,
the flash still works. but it no longer allows me to switch to wireless mode.  When I press the button the flash locks up. I have to open the batter cover to turn the flash off.. the flash itself still works on the camera. Yes its a $71 flash so I shouldnt be surprised that it has had problems within the year of owning it.  I should be surprised that it still works at all.
Its still a well made flash.. it still works, but it doesnt work for everything anymore.. so I am now left in the position where I need to decide if I buy another one or spend the money on a Sony flash..

--------original review ------------

Alright, first of all, I had no good expectations for this thing. I thought it was going to be cheap thin plastic, I thought it was going to have a screen like those old pocket lcd video games they used to sell when I was a kid.. Maybe the fact I was dreading getting this to see what I just wasted my money on helped make me as happy as I was when I opened this thing.. It's awesome.. Its HUGE, much larger than I expected, good solid thick plastic and its put together very very well.  the manual leaves you wondering how to use the thing, so that could use some improvement, but if you search Yongnuo 560 III on youtube you will get some video's that show how to use the buttons.

I bought this for a Sony A58 and it works just fine on there.. The A58 has the new Sony ""multi interface shoe"" I was hoping the A58's wireless flash setting would fire this thing, and it does, but the timing seems to be off, the photo doesn't show any flash in it.  If I use regular on camera flash settings I can trigger the flash properly.  So of course I have ordered the 603's to help trigger this thing remotely, not that I will do that much..  The 603s do not work with the sony without a mod. open up the unit and solder a 120K ohm or 130K ohm resistor between the VIN (+ terminal) and the J6 terminal (yellow wire). It works, at first you might think that it doesn't, if the screen on your flash has this -- instead of a flash powrer, just hit the buttons to cycle through the powers and then your flash will work great.
Search YouTube for the mod, it will walk you through it.

The thing isn't ttl, so when you get it you will be learning how to use a flash,, Like a moron I started at 100iso in my dark living room with full power and quickly learned I had to move to 800 and bring the flash power down..  And I started playing around with the black foamy thing  Neil Van Niekerk has done some videos and written articles about.  Do a search on it for your self, amazon removed my links for his page. not affiliated with the guy at all.  it helped me a lot to learn about using flash.

I was slow to order this thing thinking it wouldnt work with my Sony, and that is not the case..  If you have the old minolta hot shoe you will need a converter ","When I first bought this thing, I had low expectations, I but it was awesome being large and well put together. The manual is lacking, but you can find youtube videos about it. I bought this for the Sony A58 and it works find. I needed the 603s to trigger this thing remotely. You can search youtube for this mode. The thing isn’t ttl, so you need to learn to use flash. I thought this wouldn’t work with Sony, but it does. Update, flash works but doesn’t let me use wireless mode. I am not sure if I should buy another one or not. Update, drop to 2 star loss of wireless function"
"I purchased this laptop September 25th 2013.and I am truly disappointed with this product from this seller. When I first received the product, the touch screen was not working. I contacted the seller and got no resolution. Lucky for me (so I thought), the touchscreen eventually started to work. A bout 2 months later the battery stopped holding charge. Even when the power chord is connected it doesn't charge. Another charger and battery from the exact same laptop also doesnt work. I just checked the return policy from this seller and you could only return 1 month after purchase. Today is June 27th 2014 (less than one year of purchase). This laptop doesnt work.","I am disappointed with this laptop.

"I do a lot of phone tech support (and have for many years now), so I rely on my headset heavily. I need the sound to be loud and clear on BOTH ends, and I need them to be comfortable enough to wear for many hours at a time.

It's hard to believe these $10 Panasonic KX-TCA60 headsets are still the best I've tried out of 8 different models / 4 different brands over the past 8+ years (and many of the ones I tried were much more expensive). For example, I've had $40+ Plantronics models that could not match the volume level and clarity of these. Even the Uniden headset that came with my Uniden 5.8Ghz phones was inferior to the sound quality and volume of these.

I been using these KX-TCA60's for years now and they're all I'll buy any more. I currently use mine with my Uniden TRU-9485 handsets and I'm extremely happy (so are my callers, since we hear each other loud & clear).

I will admit that I purchase them two at a time because I've had some KX-TCA60's that only lasted a couple years (for example, the swivel for the boom does eventually get loose over a long period of time to the point where it won't stay where you've adjusted it) but that's after heavy use and abuse. That plus I tend to roll over the cord with my chair sometimes and it can only endure that so many times before you damage it, but overall these are really pretty rugged.

I would definitely recommend these to anyone who has handsets of ANY brand with headset jacks on them (like I said, these work better with my Uniden phones than my Uniden headset does!), and who spends long hours in calls each day. I hope Panasonic never stops making these!!","I do a phone tech support and need good headsets. These $10 Panasonic KX-TXA60 headsets are the best I tried over 8 models/brands over 8+ years.

"I've used various NiMH chargers for years, and this is probably the worst I've ever used.  I keep it next to my computer to charge AA batteries for my bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and the batteries last approximately 1.5 days before they need another charge.  If I put the exact same batteries into my $15 energizer charger I bought from walgreens, they last for weeks.  This is regardless of whether I use the new Sony batteries that came with the device, or the energizers I get from walgreens.

It's also very aggressive about reporting that batteries are past their usable lifetime.  Some of the batteries I just got with the device are already dead after only a few charge cycles.

Perhaps I got a dud, but I will stay away from sony chargers in the future.",These are the worst NiMH charge I’ve had in year. I use them to charge my keyboard and mouse and it only last 1.5 before an additional charge. Using the same batteries in a $15 Walmart charger lasts for 2eeks.

"As everyone should know, any HDMI cable should be the same besides a few minor differences in version so I bought this cheap HDMI cable rather than expensive lies at retail stores, etc. I have to say that I am very satisfied with this product. You get a long cable that you can connect your tablet to your TV and still have the tablet not too far from you. The sound and video works perfectly. I haven't tested anything HD yet like 1080p movies but I'm sure it would work.

So I would recommend you buy this if you want an affordable mini-HDMI to HDMI cable that works and is long.","HDMI cables are the same outside of minor differences in version so I bought this cheap version.

"for its size the sound is awesome. I bought this to use when kayaking. The only negative concern is it's blutooth range. It's horrible. I did a test using my iPhone 5 and walked away from it maintaining a clear line of sight and only got about 12- 15"" away and lost connection. The worst test was when my phone was on my lap and speaker was 2' away if i crossed my legs and lost line of sight it lost connection. They need to do better with the bluetooth range to make this truly an outstanding speaker. Would i buy again. maybe yes.. maybe no. For the kayak i can make it work otherwise i'll uses my bose airplay","This thing is awesome for its size. But it has terrible bluetooth range, about only 15’’ away.

"I have had so many problems with 64gb cards NOT working in my Note 3 and Note 2014, that I was very leery of spending yet more money.  Because this vendor's description says ""formatted specifically for..."", I decided to try, one more time.

Voila!  This card is working like it should in my Note 3!!!  I have a huge music collection which I like to have with me to feed through my car BT stereo, and I can finally HAVE all of my music with me, all of the time - no matter the mood of the day, I am able to play what I want!  I also have a huge photo collection, which I need with me at all times as a portfolio, and I can now do that, as well.

I will be buying another for my Note 2014, and expect to have the same good experience.

"I purchased this micro SD card to use in a contour+ camera that I have mounted in my vehicle (I often make interstate drives) and wanted to extend the record time greater than the 32gb cards that I have.  I have not made a long trip with this card at this point, but it tested to be 64GB and has quick speed for video.  I generally get about 8 hours of recording on a 32GB card so on a drive longer than that, I have to change cards.  I expect this card to far exceed record time to cover any driving time I will make in a single day.  It immediately formatted to use in the Contour camera and works great.  I recommend this card if you want a higher speed/higher capacity card.","I purchased this micro SD to use in a camera I mounted on my vehicle and I wanted to extend the record time of my 32 gb cards.

"Imation Atom 8G USB Thumb Drive / B001B1AIIQ

When my old USB thumb drive was broken beyond all repair, I really fretted over the replacement. I wanted something small and unobtrusive, due to the many times that I had seen thumb drives damaged by brushing against the extruding drive in accident. I am really surprised that there does not yet exist a model that can lie flush against the side of the computer, but this Atom drive seemed the next best thing.

The Atom is remarkably small - the shown image of it next to a small paperclip is accurate - and it communicates amiably so far with every machine I have used it with. The drive initially came loaded with some security software, but as I was not interested in it, I removed it from the drive, and have had no problems with the drive operation doing so. I couldn't be happier with my little thumb drive, in fact.

EDIT: Literally one month after buying this, the black plastic fractured and broke badly, after VERY light use and carrying in my purse. Considering that the thumb drive I had before this lasted for 3+ years in my purse, and considering the sizable price for this drive, I am very disappointed. I originally gave this USB five stars for ease of use (as you can see above), but with quality this poor, there's no reason to spend money on this device. I would return it if I could at this point, but I no longer have the original packaging.

EDIT2: And Imation has still not returned my email informing them about the problem and requesting that they replace the thumb drive as it must surely still be under some form of warranty. I am terribly disappointed and will not buy from Imation again.

"This little light is a very nice unit... premium build quality, very lightweight and thin design, responsive and ergonomic on/off button.  The light cast is a pleasant warm light, of about the perfect brightness.  I've been using it for about two weeks now, approx 30-60 minutes per night, and have not yet run through the first set of batteries.

My only fault is that the bendable neck is a tad short, I find that I need to clip the light to the side of my pages to get sufficient illumination across the page without having the bright pinpoint of the led shine in my eyes.  I am also concerned a bit by the battery usage... I opted for this less expensive model though, and knew what I was ordering.

I will be ordering the rechargeable version today, it appears to have a slightly longer neck and not needing new batteries every so often should be a plus.","This small light has premium build quality, lightweight design and responsive on/off button.

"The VDOMUS Premium Rain Handheld Shower Head is great! I received this shower head yesterday and my husband installed it last night. It was very easy to install (can use it on the existing plumbing that comes from the wall). In one evening, the detachable shower head made my life A LOT easier.

I was able to use this detachable shower head last night to rinse her hair and there were no screams! haha
I know that every home is different, but it had just enough water pressure to get a good rinse on your hair or body. It wasn't too hard and it wasn't too soft.
After I got my daughter out of the tub, I put the dog in. Once again, the ease of rinsing was perfect! I felt like everyone was a lot more clean and rinsed off after using this.
I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest opinion.","VDOMUS Premium Rain Handheld SHower Head is great and easy to install.

"This cover offers decent quality for the price. the plastic shell backing fits snugly and the cover shuts with a magnetic connection. I purchased a similar cover with metal hinges and this one is a one-piece design; much better and reliable. This will not save your device from devastating falls or smashes, but will take nice care of the iPad if you're already careful with it.

"I bought these as a replacement when my Panasonic earphones of the same type died on me after almost a year. I'll be comparing the 2. I chose these because I had a gift card and was a little short to get the Panasonics again (really liked them!).

The Panasonic phones were thin whereas the Koss are at least twice as thick making them feel bulky and heavy. The earpiece that goes over the back of the ear is hard and unforgiving. I actually have to hook it in the stem of my glasses with some hair after a short time or it starts to hurt!

About the only thing I like BETTER about the Koss ones is the cord length. It's longer though it's missing the longer cord on one side that allows the user to put the cord behind the neck preventing things from catching it.

For a cheap pair of phones, these work but if you can spring for the Panasonics or better.","

"This book is specific to Snow Leopard, which means it's obsolete for anyone currently buying a new Mac.  But if you're buying one used (or an archaeologist reading this millions of years in the future) you might find it useful.

Apple has a reputation for design and ease of use, but the nuts and bolts of a Mac are harder to grasp or learn about.  Since Macs don't come with an instruction manual (just a shiny little book that says ""hello"" on the cover) it's useful to have something like this around.

It's beautifully illustrated with screen captures, but strangely organized - things will appear in the sidebar that aren't explained until much later. It can be difficult to use as a quick reference, which, in my opinion, is really what an everyday user needs; this is meant to be read cover to cover, and by that point, you're a Mac genius.","This is specific to Snow Leopard and is obsolete for new Macs.

"I wanted to sync my iPod as quickly as possible, and the documentation (printed and online) suggested that firewire would be faster than USB or USB2.0. But I've synced several times each way, and at least this PCMCIA firewire cardbus is *slower* than USB2.0.

Plus, the iPod battery is recharged during a USB/USB2.0 sync, but *not* during a firewire sync. So not only does the firewire sync take longer just for the music, and not only is additional time (and a connection) required to recharge the battery, but the battery also drains *during* the firewire sync, making it a triply long process.

I'm returning this, and going back to USB.","

"I've had this mouse for around 6 months now.  I am a data analyst and make around 8000-10000 movements a day with my mouse.  I bought this thinking the more ergonomic design would reduce the chronic pain in my hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder.  It is better than a traditional mouse design by about 30%.  Meaning you will probably be on disability 30% faster with a regular mouse.  I am now looking for something with better ergonomics.  For the last 10 days  my right hand has been swollen and it hurts a little more each day.  This mouse has only slowed down the inevitable not prevented it.  Apart from the physical assessment of this mouse it is pretty good but not perfect.  There is a glitch in the software that sometimes freezes up your programed functions if you are away from your computer for a while.  You have to go into your mouse settings and click on apply settings then exit and that usually resets it.  Its a little annoying when this happens.  Over all a fairly good mouse.","I bought this ergonomic mouse 6 month ago and I thought it would reduce the chronic hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder pain that I have. I think it is 30% better than the traditional mouse. This mouse has only slowed down the inevitable but not prevented it. The physical assessment of the mouse is good but not perfect. It has software glitches that freeze up programs when you are away and the fix is a little annoying. But overall, a good mouse.

"Just got this refurb Nook as my first ebook reader, and I am very happy.  Like any other refurb electronic device I've bought in the past, the only way to tell this was a refurb was by looking at the receipt.  Otherwise, it looks brand-new, perfect finish and screen, and so far, it works fine.  Downloaded a couple free books from the B&N Store, a bunch of Project Gutenberg books, something from the Google bookstore, and a PDF, and they have all worked fine.  Even tried out the web browser.  It works, but with the slow refresh rate of the e-ink screen and the small size of the color LCD, it's more of a novelty than something you would use as a primary internet device.  Unfortunately, the browser doesn't support downloading, so you can't go the Project Gutenberg website and download a book directly from the site to the Nook.  Hopefully that gets changed in the future, that would be nice to be able to do!  But this is not a make-or-break issue, just a convenience I would like.  Otherwise, I'm very happy with this purchase!","Bought this refurb Nook as my first ebook reader and I am happy. Like any refurbed device I bought before , it is hard to tell it was refurb.
